# CVE-2023-43641

This directory contains a simple PoC for libcue [CVE-2023-43641](https://github.com/lipnitsk/libcue/security/advisories/GHSA-5982-x7hv-r9cj). Downloading [CVE-2023-43641-poc-simple.cue](CVE-2023-43641-poc-simple.cue) should trigger the bug on most GNOME systems, because [tracker-miners](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/tracker-miners) automatically scans files in `~/Downloads`. If the filename has a `.cue` extension, then tracker-miners uses [libcue](https://github.com/lipnitsk/libcue) to scan the file. The PoC triggers an out-of-bounds array access, which causes the tracker-extract process to crash.

We are delaying the release of the [full PoC](https://youtu.be/beOwspTnc1Y), which exploits the vulnerability to get code execution in tracker-extract.
