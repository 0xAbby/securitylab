# GitHub Security Lab Meet-Up

## About
The GitHub Security meetup is a great occasion to connect with other security researchers or developers, by discussing all things security, sharing tips and tricks for writing CodeQL queries, discussing variant analysis and other security research techniques, integrating with developer and security response workflows, and more.

The format of the meetup will be somewhat casual, with :
- Lightning Talks - Several short talks (10min).
- Networking - Plenty of time to mingle and discuss around some drinks and appetizers

Do you want to present a lightning talk session about a security technique, a tool, a vulnerability? Please reach out to us at securitymeetup@github.com
