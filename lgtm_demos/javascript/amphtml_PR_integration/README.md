# AMP HTML pull-request integration

[Pull Request #13060](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/13060) is a great example of LGTM's pull-request integration feature. In this pull request, [@lannka](https://github.com/lannka) wants to revert a change made by [@rsimha](https://github.com/rsimha) because it "breaks the regex". Within 15 minutes, LGTM posted a [comment](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/13060#issuecomment-360860032) on the pull request, saying that it introduces a new alert for "Regular expression injection". As [@rsimha](https://github.com/rsimha) explains in the next [comment](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/13060#issuecomment-360865628), he changed the regular expression to fix a security vulnerability. This pull request was going to reintroduce the vulnerability! Luckily, LGTM caught the problem quickly and the pull request was fixed before it got merged.
