# Semmle Demos

This open source repository contains demos of Semmle's products: [QL](https://semmle.com/ql) and [LGTM](https://lgtm.com/). Many of the demos are examples of security vulnerabilities that were found by a QL query. These demos contain step-by-step instructions on how to build a QL query that finds the vulnerability.

## How do I run the demos?

Each demo consists of a snapshot database and a series of query files. Each query is annotated with useful information and to explain it's purpose. To run a demo, import the associated files into the the [QL for Eclipse](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/running-queries-ide) plugin, and run the queries. For detailed instructions on installing QL for Eclipse, importing snapshots, and running queries, see the [QL for Eclipse online help](https://help.semmle.com/ql-for-eclipse/Content/WebHelp/install-plugin-free.html). You can also run the queries in the [interactive query console](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/using-query-console).

## How do I learn more about QL?

QL is Semmle's variant analysis engine, and there is [extensive documentation](https://help.semmle.com/QL/learn-ql/) available to help you learn to write your own queries. You can also explore the QL queries and libraries by visiting the [Semmmle/ql repository](https://github.com/semmle/ql). QL is open source, and we welcome contributions or improvements from the communityâ€“see our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Semmle/ql/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further information.
