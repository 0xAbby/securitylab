# Semmle Demos

This open source repository contains demos of Semmle's products: QL and LGTM. Many of the demos are examples of security vulnerabilities that were found by a QL query. These demos contain step-by-step instructions on how to build a QL query that finds the vulnerability.

## How do I run the demos?

You can use the [interactive query console](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/using-query-console) or the [QL for Eclipse](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/running-queries-ide) plugin.
